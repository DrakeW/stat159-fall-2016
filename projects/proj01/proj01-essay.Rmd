### Your first reproducible project

This project assignment involves writing a paper/document about the tools
we've covered so far. You have to describe (in your own words) how you work 
on your assignment (tell us about your experience):

- Explain what is a Makefile and its role in the RR workflow
- Explain what is Git, and its role in the RR workflow
- Explain what is pandoc
- Explain what is markdown
- Write a narrative about how you worked out this project
- What resources you used to get the job done?
- What were the "easy" parts?
- What were the challenging parts?
- What things you were stuck with?
- Did you work with and/or get help from someone else?
- How much time did it take?


### Instructions

- Create a new directory
- Add a `.gitignore` file
- Initialize the directory with Git
- Create the file structure:

```
project/
	.gitignore
	README.md
	paper/
		sections/
			00-abstract.md

			03-conclusions.md
		paper.md
	images/
