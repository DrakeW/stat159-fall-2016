### Housekeeping

- If you have a Mac, you're good to go.
- If you have a Windows, you need to install __git-bash__: 
[https://git-for-windows.github.io/](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)
- Another option for Windows users is to install [Win-Bash](http://win-bash.sourceforge.net/)


### Some Terminology

- __Unix-like__ refers to a family of operating systems that 
includes Linux, Android, iOS (iPhone/iPad), and Mac OS X.
- The way that you interact with a Unix-like system is by using the command line.
- __Terminal__ (or terminal emulator) refers to the program that gives us a command line (i.e. provides a command line access to Unix). The terminal is where you type the commands. 
- The __kernel__ is the core of the operating system in Unix.  It's what takes care of allocating time and memory to program.
- __Shell__ is the outside of the kernell. The shell is the outer layer of the operating system. That's what you see when you open up a Terminal window.
- The shell interacts with the user (think of it as your working environment). Every time you execute a command, the shell will send requests to the kernel. The kernel will then do its thing and results will then be returned back to the shell so that you can interact with them again.
- There are several types of shells. Perhaps the most common one is the __bash__ (Bourne Again Shell) shell.

Many people use the terms "command line", "bash", and "shell" interchangeably. Although they are related terms, they are not synonyms. Bash is a type of shell. All shells require a command line interpreter or terminal emulator. That's where the user type commands, which are handled by the shell and send to the operating system (based on Unix).
