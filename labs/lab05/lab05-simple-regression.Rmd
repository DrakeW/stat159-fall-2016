### Description and Data

The goal of this project is to create an `.Rmd` file to perform a simple
regression analysis and reproduce the main results published in 
_An Introduction to Statistical Learning_, 
Chapter 3, Section 3.1 Simple Linear Regression.

- Book: __An Introduction to Statistical Learning__
- Authors: Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani
- Web: [http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/data.html](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/data.html)
- Data set: Advertising data
- Source: [http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Advertising.csv](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Advertising.csv)

The directory `lab05` contains an auxiliary R script that can help you
walk through the basic regression analysis.


### Preliminary steps

- Open or download a copy of the book's pdf file.
- Take a look at the book's section 3.1 (pages 61-71).
- You will be working on the regression model of equation 3.1 (page 61).
- Create a new directory for this lab practice.
- `cd` into the directory of this lab.
- Download a copy of the data file:
  - `curl -O http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Advertising.csv`
- In RStudio open a new `.Rmd` file.
- Save the `.Rmd` file e.g. `simple-regression.Rmd`
- Use the `.Rmd` file to mix your narrative and code.


### Analysis

In your `.Rmd` file, open code chunks and write code to perform the 
tasks listed below. Learn how to __knit__ an `.Rmd` document, and become
familiar with the chunk options.

__Import Data.__ Read the dataset in R, and inspect the data frame. Check its structure, dimensions, take a peek, etc.

__Exploratory Analysis.__ Get a histogram and boxplot, as well as summary statistics for the variables `TV` and `Sales`. Does it make sense to fit a
regression line between `TV` and `Sales`?

__Regression Model.__
Use the function `lm()` to regress `Sales` onto `TV` by fitting the model:
$$
Sales = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times TV
$$
Inspect the contents of the object `"lm"`. It contains things like
`coefficients`, `residuals`, `fitted.values`, etc.
Confirm that the regression coefficients are: $\beta_0$ = 7.03, 
and $\beta_1$ = 0.0475.

__Regression Line.__
Try to reproduce the figure 3.1 (page 62): scatterplot with the fitted 
regression line of `sales` onto `TV`. Learn about the chunk options for
graphics.

__Residual Sum of Squares.__ 
Use the `residuals` of the `"lm"` object and write code to calculate the RSS 
(Residual Sum of Squares). Use the RSS formula of eq. 3.16 (see page 69).

__Residual Standard Error.__
Write code to calculate the RSE (Residual Standard Error)
according to the formula of eq. 3.15 in page 69. (RSE is an estimate of the variance $\sigma^2$).

__Standard Error of Regression Coefficients.__
Write code to calculate the Standard Errors (SE) for the regression 
coefficients (see eq. 3.8, page 66).

__Confidence Interval for Coefficients.__
Write code to calculate the confidence intervals (see eqs. 3.10 and 3.11, 
page 66), of the regression coefficients. More specifically, compute a 95% 
confidence interval for $\beta_0$ and confirm its value: [6.130, 7.935].
Likewise, compute a 95% confidence interval for $\beta_1$ and confirm 
its value: [0.042, 0.053].


#### Reproduced Results

In summary, you should reproduce the following material from section 3.1:

- Figure 3.1 (page 62): Regression line with data points
- Table 3.1 (page 68): Coefficients of the least squares model
- Table 3.2 (page 69): RSE, R2 and F-statistics of the least squares model
- 95% Confidence Interval for $\beta_0$ (page 66)
- 95% Confidence Interval for $\beta_1$ (page 66)
- Residual Standard Error _RSE_ (page 69)
- R-square statistic (page 69)


### Running R scripts from the command line

So far you've been knitting the `.Rmd` file within RStudio. This can be very
user friendly but reduces reproducibility. Therefore you also need to 
learn how to _knit_ and _render_ things from the command line.

- Switch to the command line.
- `cd` to this lab's directory
- We'll use the `Rscript` command as follows:
- `Rscript -e "library(rmarkdown); render('simple-regression.Rmd')"`

You can find more information about running R in non-interactive mode
in this tutorial: [https://github.com/gastonstat/tutorial-R-noninteractive](https://github.com/gastonstat/tutorial-R-noninteractive)


### Makefile

Now that you know one way to run R scripts from the command line, write a 
Makefile for this lab. You should be able to simply run `make`
from the command line, and get the html document.

Include a `clean` rule to remove the compiled html document.
