### What is Git?

Git is an open-source _Version Control Software_, to manage changes to source code and text files. 
The purpose of Git is to __keep track of changes that you make to files and directories__, whether those changes are adding, editing, deleting, or moving files. For these reasons, Git is an excellent tool to manage a project, or a set of files, as they change over time.
